# Advanced Tutorial: Creating a Financial Analyst Agent with Council

This tutorial will build up the key components for the source code in this [repository](https://github.com/chain-ml/council-financial-analyst-agent). 

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial describes the process and implementation details for a **Financial Analyst** Agent that can answer user questions about a company using their financial documents, real-time information from Google and historical market data. It provides an example of building an agent that leverages different technologies, such as document similarity search and automatic code generation, and unifying every component using the council framework.

If you haven't already, please review the [First Example](https://council.dev/en/stable/getting_started/first_example.html) in the Council [docs](https://council.dev/en/stable/index.html).
